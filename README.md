Trivia Game

Greetings!  In this game, you'll be presented with 10 questions to answer.  Don't freak out -- they're multiple choice!  And besides, no one is going to die if you don't get the answers.  Just wing it and have fun.

Oh yeah, they're timed.  No pressure.  

Good luck!

(your score will be displayed when you've completed all the questions)

((please note that the game is based on The Oatmeal's app named "Is your cat plotting to kill you?"))
